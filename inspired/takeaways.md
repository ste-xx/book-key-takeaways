### INSPIRED: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love

We are looking to develop six reference customers in our specific target market or segment, so, the idea is to find six similar customers.
For example, first develop six references for the financial services industry, then six for the manufactoring industry and so on.

If you are working on an important and difficult problem, you will likely be overwhelmed with customers that want to participate. It really is a good deal, and customers know this.

You find you are having real trouble recuriting even four or five prospective customers for this effort, then it's very possible you're chasing a problem that isn't that important, and you will almost certainly have a very hard time selling this product.

Users choose their devices and platforms because they value what's different, not what's the same.

Unrelevant ob ein Testuser etwas "schön findet"/"geändert haben will". Relevant ist ob er die Aufgabe gelöst hat.
